title:  "Slow Wi-Fi on iPhone 6/6S or iOS9? It's probably your router."

Something that almost slipped by me was the fact that my iPhone 6 was only getting around 30mbps over Wi-Fi, despite my internet connection being 100mbps down. I know for a fact the iPhones have been able to hit that speed for some time now, so seeing the latest model being throttled to 30mbps seemed odd. I was only able to notice this after running a quick speed test in the speedtest.net app, for day to day usage such as web browsing and listening to podcasts it didn't really affect anything, so if I hadn't decided to run that speedtest I probably would have never noticed.

After restarting the phone, forgetting and rejoining the network and resetting the iPhone's network settings didn't solve it I started to think it was a problem with the iPhone itself - at best a software bug in iOS 8, and at worst a faulty Wi-Fi chip. This was right around the corner from the iPhone 6S and iOS9 launches, I knew I was upgrading to both so I decided to leave it for the time being and thought it would probably fix itself.

When I finally did get my iPhone 6S I was surprised to see the problem persisted. It was highly unlikely that I had 2 phones with faulty Wi-Fi chips (even 1 would surprise me due to Apple's quality control), or that I alone was experiencing these iOS Wi-Fi bugs, so the next logical place to look at was obviously the router (which I had largely disqualified in this case aside from rebooting it once).

After tweaking the Wi-Fi settings and rebooting it a few more times to no avail, I realized a hard reset was the only option. I was tempted to reset and then restore the old settings from the router's built in backup function but decided to start fresh just to be safe. And sure enough after a router reset and setup as new the Wi-Fi problems on the iPhone were solved, and the phone was easily hitting the max down speed of my connection.
