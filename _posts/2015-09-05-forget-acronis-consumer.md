title:  "Forget Acronis' True Image Consumer Products"

Aside from my NAS which backs itself up to Crashplan, my backup program of choice for my local files has been Acronis' True Image. It's a solid program which has worked well in both backup and more importantly recovery. However the last few versions of True Image (their consumer facing product for home users) have not been great.

The downward trend began with the cloud, and Acronis trying to shoe horn their overpriced cloud subscription service into True Image (kind of annoying when you just want local backup, although they do have a separate program now called True Image Cloud at a reasonable price, but the damage has been done). Each iteration of True Image has also had the UI simplified far too much (it now resembles a touch screen mobile app rather than a desktop backup program), there have been several cases of features from previous versions being cut, and persistent bugs that have no solutions in sight, aside from a kb article on their site acknowledging the issue. One example of this was the Bitlocker bug, where an encrypted disk's backup would take up far more space than normal making it quite difficult to store multiple versions. They finally resolved this years later, but you have to buy True Image 2016 for Bitlocker backups to work properly...

All of these issues compounded to make me look for an alternative. After some quick research, I discovered the solution to my woes was closer than expected. It's been known under many different monikers, but they seem to have settled on [Acronis Backup 11.5](http://www.acronis.com/en-us/business/backup/workstation/) for the time being. While Acronis market this to small and medium businesses its perfectly usable as a home consumer, and comes with a plethora of options giving you the ability to customise your backups exactly the way you want. Reliability and performance has been flawless, and best of all Acronis' business products actually seem to receive periodic updates and fixes rather than forcing people to upgrade to next year's version!

At its core True Image is still a solid backup program, but the direction Acronis decided to take it means it does not meet my needs any more. Backup 11.5 is exactly what I want, and what True Image probably would have looked like if some different decisions had been made. If you want a powerful and flexible local backup program that still manages to keep things relatively simple (hey, its backup after all) then I can absolutely recommend Acronis Backup 11.5.
